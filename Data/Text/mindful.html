<br><h4><b>Finding Squares</b></h4>
<br>Time: 6 Minutes</br>
<br>Good for: Reducing Stress, Breathing practice</br>
<br>This exercise teaches children to focus on breathing while creating an
imaginary square outline. It is great because it can be done anywhere!</br>
<br>Tell your kids to look for a square in the room. Once they found one, ask
them to place their hands on their belly. Ask them to start by focusing
on any corner of their square. Instruct them to take a deep breath while
counting to 4. Count with them to 4 and remind them to feel the rise of
the air filling their belly. Ask them to have their gaze follow the
straight line to the next corner while holding their breath. Count to
4 with them. Tell them to breathe out for 4 seconds while following
the line of the square to the next corner. Ask them again to hold
their breath on the next corner for 4 seconds. Count with them and
remind them to feel the fall of their belly as they release their
breath for 4 seconds to return to the next corner. Repeat with
instructions for two rounds, then ask them to repeat it on their
own four more times. This can be done on their own 4 to 8 times
as they begin to feel calm.</br>

<br><h4><b>Mindful Posing</b></h4>
<br>Time: 6 Minutes</br>
<br>Good for: Self Confidence, Preparing to be brave, Positivity Boost</br>
<br>Power poses have been proven to help children and adults increase confidence
by simply changing their posture. This is a great activity to do in a group or one
on one in a quiet safe place. To pique the interest of the child, tell them
you are going to share a fun activity that will help them feel brave, confident,
and joyful.</br>
<br>Start by asking the kids how they feel. Then instruct them to choose one of
following two poses:</br>
    <br>1. The Champion: this pose can be practiced by standing with the feet
    hip-distance apart, fists clenched, and arms reached out to the sky, stretching
    the body as tall as possible.</br>
    <br>2. The Wonder Woman: This pose is practiced by standing tall with feet
    slightly wider than hip-distance apart and hands resting on hips.</br>
<br>Hold for 2 minutes. Feel free to play music or have them focus on thinking
about something happy. After the 2 minutes, ask them how they feel and inquire
about sharing what they imagined during the 2 minutes.</br>
<br>This can be repeated to complete both poses.</br>

<br><h4><b>Morning and Afternoon Reflections</b></h4>
<br>Time: 5 to 20 minutes</br>
<br>Good for: Present Moment Reflections, Worrying, Memory</br>
<br>The following exercise is best done in a group during class or
if you see the kids at the beginning of the day or session and the end.
Reflection helps to review the day and find highlights during their time
together to be grateful for. It gives a sense of being present. This
consistency gives kids something to look forward to and promotes sharing
their thoughts.</br>
<br>In the morning or at the beginning of a session together in a quiet space,
start by asking the kids to take three deep breaths. Share a quote that can
stimulate a short discussion and encourage interaction among the group. Example
Questions include:</br>
<br>What would happen if teachers did not come prepared to class? Why are plans
necessary?</br>
<br>What is one thing that you are grateful for in this school? If you had to
live without it for the rest of the year, how would you deal with it?</br>
<br>Who in your community has been a good listener to you? How did you know
that they were listening to you?</br>
<br>Think about a hero or heroine in social studies or history you have studied
in this school. What made this person heroic? Do you consider anyone in your
community to be a hero?</br>
<br>At the end of the day, repeat the three breaths and follow up with a question
related to the morning discussion. Then ask them to share the following responses:</br>
<br>Something I learned today…</br>
<br>I am curious about…</br>
<br>I am looking forward to tomorrow because…</br>
<br>Something I’ll do (next, later today, this weekend, next week, etc.)</br>
<br>A question I still have is…</br>
<br>I had the best feeling today when…</br>
<br>Something from today that I am thankful for is…</br>
