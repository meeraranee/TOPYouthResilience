      <br><h3><b>About the App</b></h3>
      Youths in Puerto Rico face a range of challenges, such as dealing with Adverse Childhood
      Experiences (ACEs) or negative outcomes of climate disasters. Because of this, some students may struggle with 
      difficult realities. Educators spend lots of time with their students and are often the first
      adults to notice concerning behaviors. This app is designed to help educators in Puerto Rico help
      students ages 12-17 face adversity and promote resilience by analyzing potential behavioral
      disorders and finding helpful resources. Mindful activities may also be encouraged in the classroom
      to promote a healthier learning environment and a safe space. If appropriate, educators may also
      provide information discovered with this app to parents/guardians of targeted youth. *No data will be tracked and
      saved on this app. If the user leaves the app and comes back to the dashboard, the user will have to re-enter information.
      No input is being recorded or shared with any other source.</br>
